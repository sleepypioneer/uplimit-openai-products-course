Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening, wherever you're listening from around the world. Welcome to Women in Environmental Science. I'm Sreni Nandpantala, and I have Sandy Castellano with me today. So thank you so much for coming to the podcast, Sandy. Hi, thank you. I'm excited. As am I. So to get us started, could you elaborate more on who you are, where you're from, and what work you're doing? Yeah, so I'm from New Jersey. I'm getting my master's in sustainability science, and I'm going to Montclair State. And I'm just about finished with my degree. I'm graduating this December. So it's been a really intense but fun two years in my master's. Right now, I have an internship that I'm working on. Just like finalizing everything. I did a presentation in the Geological Society of America and down in Denver last month. So being able to present like the work that took a whole month of July to do was really great. Yeah, absolutely. So excited for you. It's definitely a big accomplishment to be getting your master's this December. That's really cool. So to get us like started about your research, just like, could you elaborate more on that on your summer internship in Cameroon? Yeah, so I went to Cameroon, and that's a country located in West Africa. And we went to one of the most populated cities called Douala. And that's like located right next to the estuary. And like we refer to it as like an urbanized estuary, because in the estuary before there was a lot of like human settlements and just like construction of just like apartment buildings, like different types of infrastructure. It truly was just like a natural landscape. But over time, since the population has been increasing, there's a lot of infrastructure. So there's like we've passed by on the boats, the sediment buildings, like they were actively doing the manufacturing and like sand mining was also there. And there was just like a lot of anthropogenic activities going on also. So that is like why it's coined the term like urbanized because it's really influenced by a lot of human activities. Gotcha. So like what what are the effects of those like manufacturing things we do in that industrial or in urbanized estuary? Yeah, so what we did was we went to two of the major rivers in the estuary that drain down into like the mouth of the estuary. And like as we went up the river where the like industries are like where the cement manufacturing is happening, like we can like visibly see it in our like water samples how polluted the water is like you can see like it's changing from like where it's more like freshwater, where it's very clear. And like we saw like how like murky was getting and once we came back to analyze them back at our like field location, it was we did like manual water filtration and it was really hard. We went through so many filters and it just like showed how polluted it is and just like a lot of chemicals, a lot of heavy metals like arsenic. So that was something that we wanted to like understand like what's happening along the river like as we get closer to like human activities, how is that like affecting the water quality and like we saw it ourselves visibly we can see it. But like to see it to go like right next to like where it's actually happening was like a really big thing for us because it wasn't just like oh it's just water like no this is actually happening adjacent from like a sediment like manufacturing facility. So like it just put everything into perspective that these are human activities that are like actively changing the way that the water is and the water is also used for like fishing. So there's a lot of fishermen along the estuary. So they also know from their own observation just visually they can also see that oh we shouldn't we should avoid this area. It's like murky doesn't look good. Our quality of the fish that they're going to catch to bring to the market is also not good. They know like where to go. So just making sure like everyone is aware like that was like the big takeaway that just want to make sure everyone is informed so they're not putting themselves in harm's way. Oh that's really cool like environmental literacy and like the surrounding population. Yeah so like what kind of water filtration did you do? You said manual water filtration like that's that's crazy. Yeah manual water filtration. So our internship was part of the National Science Foundation and we had like a collaboration internationally and just like domestically. So we had people like grad and undergrads from like University of California and Davis like around like the Sacramento area and one of our other colleagues was from University of Oklahoma and I was the only one from my state in New Jersey and then we were paired up with master students in Cameroon. So we really got that cultural experience. So see like how how they approach science differently since we've all been like raised and just how like our our college years like in the in the U.S. So just seeing like the comparisons and like how well we were able to work with each other and like that month was was really great to see. Oh wow how how different was like their their scientific methods compared to what you would do in the U.S. Yeah so they're unfortunately there's a lot of wi-fi like disruptions is like power outages are pretty normal so they are just like actively using their own observations and like like running their ideas like with each other just because can't access like right away like the internet so it's a lot of like handwritten notes but which is also good too is also like reinstating like the information too but they are a lot more like detailed oriented and they have all the information like in their notebooks. So like that was like one like takeaway that I took from them that like you in the middle of the estuary we were right alongside the Atlantic Ocean we just talked to each other to like remember things or like if we had questions we based it off on like our like prior knowledge already because there's no wi-fi out in like the middle of the estuary down down in that area so we just had no no phones access to wi-fi so it really was just a word of mouth and just like communicating with each other. Yeah that's that's extremely different because right now we would rely on like just like putting it down on your phone or on a computer in the field so very very different way of working. So how was the field work there because that seems really fun. Did you get to like yeah what did you what did you do? Yeah it um so I'm Ecuadorian my parents immigrated um about like 30 years ago so I'm like really used to like our equatorial sun but the African sun was on another level was very sunny. We were out there I want to say like most of the day I think one one day we had like a 24-hour field day and we like tag-team ourselves with our other like classmates because we wanted to see like a full um full tight cycle like the high and low tides and we were only able to see if we were awake for the 24 hours so we so some people took like um like a 1 a.m to like 4 a.m shift and then other people tagged and like later like the rest of the morning so we were it was really intense. Um the sun was another thing too we all had like um the typical geology like wide berm hives. Oh awesome. Yeah it was really fun a lot of us got tan I know my friend did but it was really good work um despite all the sweat coming down because it was very humid and hot but just at the end of the day we knew exactly why we started and it's just to make sure that like everyone's informed about like their resources. Gotcha so how did that like scientific outreach look like for you while you were there? Yeah so um the language in Cameroon is um mostly French and um one of their other um just like native languages they call pidgin and they go around like the West African like countries they have like their own like dialects and takes on it so like they spoke in languages that I was unfamiliar with so our Cameroon um like classmates they would always be right next to us so if we wanted to say something they would translate in French and then translate back to us in English so like that was really helpful because I only know Spanish so French is a language that I find very hard for me um I did my best but greetings is all I can do. Gotcha yeah I mean I mean like that's that's like a start a step in learning a first new language you start with the greetings like like right now I'm learning Spanish at school and I'm not very good at it but I mean I try I can do the greetings. Yeah. So um kind of like moving moving towards your your background which is uh actually do you do you want to share more about like your background and how how it's so important for environmental science? Yeah so my background I um it's a long title I went to Syracuse University in upstate New York and um I graduated with my BS in earth science with the focus in environmental science and like that like snippet of like the focus was my um I took a couple of classes that like really tried to like intersect like the physical science aspect of geology with like the human impounds and that was really important to me. Um I I knew exactly what I wanted to do when I was 13 and I have never deviated so I feel like I'm really um like not like my other like peers that like like they're like a different journey but I I knew I needed to be in this field um like growing up since my parents are Ecuadorian we did go back to Ecuador a lot when I was younger and even back then when I was like around like seven um like I saw a lot of like air pollution and coming back to the U.S. I saw like we didn't have that I think in terms of equity I just feel like that was not right and that always stick with me and I've always wanted to know like what can I do like what can I study so I can be there to help and going into feel like environmental science as a whole there's so many different niches in there but like for me I knew I needed to understand the geology and like why certain things are happening but like in terms of like natural disasters like why is it that like the west coast is having um earthquakes and on the east coast we don't have it like what's happening in South America why is there so much um like they like suffer from like landslides and like also like what kind of eruptions so like I wanted to know like the why and that's why I was in my earth science major and like the focus was just so like connected to like the human impact because I I just want to help people and like my way is through geology because that's what I studied for four years and I have that like prior knowledge in mind like coupled with my masters and like sustainable science it's more of like relating it towards like the social equity aspect of it and like like environmental justice so like I I just like want to figure out like what's happening in our society that's like making certain groups like underrepresented groups susceptible to like different disasters like why are there certain groups that are having less of um a water quality and it's just in terms of the geography and like income so things like that I I just feel like it's not right just needs to be like amplified like that message should be that we all have resources on the planet and we it should all be clean and accessible to everybody and that's like my like my motivation when I'm like doing my masters when I did my undergrad so I feel like really passionate about this I'm going for my PhD so I I'm just gonna keep going that's awesome wonderful like goal to have and I think that like like you mentioned it's it's like what I what I really like about environmental science is it's not just like one thing like it's not just studying the water it's studying the water but also like the psychology of the people using the water the policies associated with that water and like different toxins or toxicology that might be associated with the water there's so many different avenues you can go down and it's just like instead of becoming a jumbled mess like you might think it would be it's like a beautiful pattern of some sort just like so many different connections you can make within I really love that um and I like how how like like geology is great I love geology um uh do you have a favorite rock um I do I um I really like Coquina it's a sedimentary type of rock and just like all those like shell cements together I just love it like I love like coastal environments so that that type of rock like sedimentary rocks in general as a whole I like I love them yeah they're really they're really really great um I will say pillow basalt is my is my like favorite rock but if we're going yes true it's just so fun like but like mineral wise it would be flora uh flora um that's just beautiful oh yeah especially um like when you go a little bit more in depth I see under like a microscope like a thin section of it oh yeah it's very pretty too there's certain minerals like once you like rotate the stage so like the microscope you can see like some of them go from light to dark and it's really beautiful like what these minerals can do just visually and that's like one of the standouts like how to identify it so in general rocks is amazing they do so much even here longer than us absolutely I have not done like um the thin sections looking at the sections in real life I've seen like pictures of them on the internet but that just seems extremely cool um but like kind of kind of like maneuvering from your geology background to what you did in Cameroon so sorry I was reading that you did like a geochemistry analysis could you elaborate more on that on that like analysis and how and its impact that it had yeah so uh the geochemistry analysis like the geo is um just like that prefix just like associated with just like like the earth and like our our goal was to look at what's happening along the water column so we were looking at specific um parameters um like we it's collectively known as like physical chemical parameters and like we looked at things like ph um dissolve oxygen salinity and um we use um like handheld um like water quality machines and like we just whenever we picked a sampling location um like we split up into like groups and there was like one person designated to like find our exact GPS location and then other people for just like slowly collecting the water samples and other people with like the actual gear and instruments to like place it into the water and then just like wait a couple seconds until it stabilizes and then we pick it up and then like we have like a note taker there um but we had like our instruments that we used and they were able to collect a lot of um different like parameters but like I what my group we focus on like dissolve oxygen ph and salinity and like what they were able to tell us was that the water chemistry is changing along um along the river so like when we get closer to the estuary that is um contains more fresh water we see a difference when we're going along like up to like the rivers like where there's more influence from like human activity so like we like noticed that there was just a trend where like the water was getting more polluted as we got closer to human settlements and just like other types of activities like sand mining that it was dirtier there were more heavy metals there so like that um that was something that like we wanted to know like to pinpoint exactly at what location is that happening so then we can see go dive a little bit deeper and to understand like what's happening in that region collectively like what factors are are making this water current industry show us these results and um so like we learned a lot just like looking at the water in general but there was like another portion where we looked at the sediments because sediments can also hold a lot of of um like a lot of toxins a lot of different like heavy metals that you don't want to like appear in like any of your like water or your food um so like that was like another aspect but like I our our group focus mostly on the water and um another group focus on like the sediments um but it was really interesting to see that in real time like when we had the actual machine in our hands see like actually like stabilized and like what's happening and we can see it every time we move along the river like how much is changing so that's like really what our main takeaway was like why why is it changing like what's the cause where exactly is it happening to like investigate further to like understand like why is it one thing one factor is like a couple factors so like our main thing was like understanding the why gotcha yeah yeah yeah I mean like your your did you say you were present you've presented it already or you are going to present it yeah I um I presented it last month at the GSA um so like that's like just like a conference with a lot of a lot of geologists and a lot in general a lot of scientists from the environmental science field as a whole so that it was amazing to be with people who have such similar values and people who have years or decades of experience it's like bouncing off that like being in their like space and getting to interact with them that was it was priceless you can't it's just not every day that we see like professors from like different universities come to one location and we're all just presenting our work so I presented um I work at GSA in Denver and um it was really fun it it kind of like allowed me a chance to like think back to when I was in Cameroon and when we first got it and it was just like preliminary results and like after we did analysis then we saw we were able to do like conclusions and like be able to like evaluate like what what other further work can we do but in general like to be able to communicate that science to other people that may not be in our field of like geochemistry but maybe they're just like interested in like what's happening in estuary in general um that was really exciting I got evaluated by a couple of people that's what happens at GSA to evaluate you for like student presentations um so like that was a little bit nerve-wracking but I had my friend from the internship we were our posters were right next to each other so like we had each other for support and that was really great but in general just like communicating that science is is what it really is all about because at the end of the day like we want information to be shared and to like be well received and like understood yeah absolutely very true like it's it's not it's not just about doing the research it's about like sharing it with the rest of the community and help them help them apply your research just like how how um you were like helping the people know that don't use this water like it's really bad so like um you are from uh your parents and you are from Ecuador so like why is it important for latinas to be in environment in earth science or just any science in general yeah I think we I just like I think collectively like as a community we do have like our own like shared experiences our own different takes on like what's happening around us and that's something that I feel like should be shared too because if if in general like the field was just like one specific type of um like background and if it was like just stayed as a monoculture we wouldn't be able to like get perspectives from different types of people from different types of backgrounds and I feel like we we all deserve a place at the table like it's very white male dominated um and I just feel like in general science is for everyone um it really does need to be a place where regardless of any any type of like differences and like background like race identity or like religion it should be a place where everyone is open and like has a spot like shouldn't have to force your way just it's open to everyone and I think just like in general like latinas we have I think we're like very family oriented so like I feel like if there's more latinas it would just get the message out more to understand like what's happening and happening around us like what's happening in their environment too so I saw a couple very few latinas in GSA but when I did I went and I approached and I listened to their poster presentation and just like really happy to see another latina because it is important to see someone that looks like you in the field and when you don't it kind of feels discouraging and it kind of like makes you second guess yourself so that's not something that like I want to like happen like underrepresented groups like latinos um like Native Americans we all deserve a spot absolutely so that we can all fight together there's no there's no like grandstanding like everyone is unique and has like a voice to share that can be beneficial for everyone and that's why you're on this podcast I mean yeah I mean like it's like it's like to to show other people that that you know I am here I am I am in environmental science I'm going to rock this place and I think you're doing just that so that's absolutely wonderful kind of like um like now um in your like master's research is it just like a continuation of of what you've done in Cameroon or is it like something slightly different yeah so for my masters um like that is like the basis of like my research so um I like the first year it was mostly getting acquainted with all of the um the classes like understanding like the social implications the economic implications of like environmental issues so that was trying to get me to like a place where I felt comfortable with information so kind of like expanding upon like my geology background to like understand like why why are like plans that are like set out by the government like um the more recent plan that the build back better plan like how is that how are those um like initiatives those um programs like how are they like monetized like how do economists know exactly what program is going to cause this and that amount like that's something that I learned um in like environmental economics which is completely out of my field I am with rocks most of the time I see how they interact how they evolved over time so like that was like a brand new thing but in general sustainability is trying to like make sure we understand like how what's happening um physically like in terms of just like the science please the physical science what's happening socially how our environment is affecting different types of groups or um people that have different backgrounds and what's happening economically so those are like the three main aspects for like my sustainability uh program that was trying to expand my knowledge to make sure like I know how how to communicate and like a little bit more about like the management side like in terms of looking at different policies like what policy can be put in place to better regulate and just like improve like different like water quality things like around the country or like um like state wise so it was really great it pushed me out to like what I know for four years four years to like expand like what I know and I just want to keep learning there's so much that in the field that I'm not an expert in but like I would love to be introduced to it like environmental economics was I had no idea but I figured it out and it's really interesting there's a lot of numbers um the equations and things like that so it definitely put me out of my comfort zone but that's like that's education just like be comfortable with the uncomfortable and I mean I was gonna ask like what are your plans for the future like do do you have like a plan for what kind of research you want to do in the future I mean I understand like you've done you've done like more policy focus work so maybe that yeah I I think I'm I want to say I'm pretty open I am like currently looking at PhD programs for hydrogeology I really found like my my topic um in undergrad I did I did so many things but collectively my main focus was I was like very interested in water so when I was in undergrad I did like flood risk assessments I did a natural hazardous assessment and like my study abroad in New Zealand and like I like tied together I I came back to water like I just want to be at the coast I want to see what's happening to the water and like in terms of like management like how is it being like sustainably managed is it being given to all types of groups um like equitably is it clean things like that so like I just want to continue the work of just like investigating like different um like coastal landscapes and also like water resources I think that's also very important to me because I do want to interact with like communities and just like to make sure like it's the science is being communicated but in a way that's not um that's not like overbearing or more like technical terms that it's more straightforward so that's like my plans are just to continue on in this research and just to keep learning more. Yeah absolutely and I think that those are those are great plans and I can't wait to hear about or read about your research in the future and what you plan on doing with it um so I wanted to ask like what advice would you give to young underrepresented people who are leaning towards environmental earth science? Yeah I would say just to really go to office hours for the professors in like the department they really are open and they love to like connect with students like that's what I did um and I just like learned so much like myself and just like opening up and like understanding like every professor has so much background and like different experiences so like if you go to office hours or if you just like by chance look at um like most colleges have like a directory with all of the professors and like their research interest um like if I would say like look at professors like what are they doing what have they done in the past if anything like bounces out at you to just like shoot them an email or just like stop by like an actual department like in person to see like get their take on it like see what kind of advice or like or just in general like to talk a little bit more about like interest that you both share so I think in general just talk to the professors they are like super accessible most of the times but just in general I think they are are really excited when they see like young students like the next generation of scientists coming to approach and see like what the world really is like absolutely I mean that's what they're there for right like professors are there to help you out so go to go to office hours I think that's some great advice um and also like what do you wish you knew um that that you what do you wish you knew now or you knew when you first started that you now know I think the financial part of it um college is very expensive it was very expensive when I started in 2014 and it remains a constant tuition on the rise collectively as a country but I would say um um just like understanding that there is funding if you seek it out so I didn't know that there was like scholarships or like um like grants to apply to um when when I was like a freshman I had no idea I just went straight away into loans and if I knew now what I knew then I wouldn't have I would have changed my approach to it I would have been a little bit more like persistent on like looking for scholarships it's like so like at the end of graduation it's not like you're not settled with an amount of loans that could have been um changed to something else or could have been a lesser amount um yeah it I think that's like one of the things that can make the college experience another layer of stress that it shouldn't be like college is a place to learn about yourself learn about like your career in the future and having that also on the back of your head is also like the turn for people and can make it getting your degree longer so I just wished it was more financial information for like incoming freshmen so that they know that there there's scholarships out there if you like go see them out if you go to your department um to make college a little bit more affordable yeah I mean anyone listening to this podcast can can look into that if they are not already doing so um so that's also another great piece of advice um and if anyone would like to to actually just like to close up our lovely conversation um just learning a lot about what it's like in between this stage of like getting your master's degree which is really cool and start starting out your your obviously amazing career um so like if anyone would like to reach out to you about questions I know I have your email but is there anywhere else um that I can reach out to you yeah I just got into LinkedIn um just introduced to that space there's so many sciences on the platform um just like sharing like different publications or like research from like different universities so I'm on LinkedIn um that's another way to like access me um like that's where I'm going to be a lot more engaged in just like showing like presentations or like career like highlights um that I hope are going to come soon in the future like as I figure out or get like acceptances to like any PhD programs that are on my list so that's really where I'm going to put like my um like all my like experiences like academically career-wise um on LinkedIn yeah I mean if you send me the link to your LinkedIn although I could look you up um I will put that in the podcast description for people to reach out to you at um and just to remind our recent listeners uh we've been speaking with Sandy and I really want to thank you for joining me here today to talk about like your your work with ROCKS um your work in Cameroon and Africa and just like college in general and some really great advice that I myself and the listeners will definitely appreciate and I really appreciated talking to you and thank you so much for your time yeah thank you you were a great interviewer I love the questions yeah I really appreciate it and thank you to the listeners for listening"}, "podcast_summary": "In this podcast transcript, Sreni Nandpantala interviews Sandy Castellano, a graduate student in sustainability science.
